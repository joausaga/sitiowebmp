Requirements
------------
Drupal 5.x
jQuery Update module (2.x branch) ( http://drupal.org/project/jquery_update )
Image module ( http://drupal.org/project/image )
SWFUpload library ( see SWFUpload installation section )

Installation
------------
1. Install jquery update properly

2. Copy the entire module directory the Drupal modules directory.

3. Login as an administrator. Enable the module in the Administer >> Build >> Modules. 
It will create all tables needed on it's own.


Installation of SWFUpload library
------------
Because of MIT license SWFUpload project has, I cannot put those files into drupal.org 
repository. Getting project files straight from creators web page also doesn`t solve 
the problem because module only needs some files from different directories and I have 
modified one of them (a handlers.js file), so i have put an archive containing files 
at address http://stuff.prog.lv/prog_gallery/files/swfupload_custompack.zip 

Unpack and put these files in prog_gallery/swfupload directory and it will work right away. 

Uninstallation
------------
1. Disable module in Administer >> Build >> Modules

2. Remove data tables in Administer >> Build >> Modules >> Uninstall
   This will remove gallery tables only. Image nodes will remain intact.
